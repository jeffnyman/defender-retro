# Retro Defender

The `source` directory contains the [Historical Source code](https://github.com/historicalsource/defender). This includes the single sound file from the [Historical source sound ROMs](https://github.com/historicalsource/williams-soundroms). The `source\labels` directory contains the binaries for the different labels of the game that were produced.

The `src` directory is the original contents with certain modifications to make it possible to compile the source code as well as fill in any gaps.
