A license for this repository is difficult.

"Defender" was produced by Williams Electronics, Inc. (1967-1985) in 1981.
In 1988, Williams, operating as WMS Industries, acquired Bally/Midway, and
now operates under WMS as Midway Games. So I suppose if there is ownership
of the source code, it would be there.
